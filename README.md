# SmartHome Bluetooth Control 🚪💡

This project simulates a smart home control system using UART over Bluetooth.  
It’s written in **Embedded C for ATmega328P**, and turns an LED ON or OFF based on serial commands.

## 🔧 What It Does
- Accepts `'1'` → Turns LED ON  
- Accepts `'0'` → Turns LED OFF  
- Meant to simulate Bluetooth commands via UART

## ⚙️ Tech Used
- Embedded C
- ATmega328P microcontroller
- UART Serial Communication
- Simulated LED device

## 🧪 How to Test
Use Proteus, Tinkercad or any AVR simulator with UART terminal.
